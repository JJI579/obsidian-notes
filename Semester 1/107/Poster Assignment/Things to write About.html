<pre><code>This is an individual assignment, and is worth 19 marks. Note that you are asked to discuss an **_existing_** solution - (and, this is NOT related to your group presentation task)

**Aims:**

Students develop their commercial awareness by developing a digital poster, which critically evaluates an existing finance technology (e.g an app or other software) of their choice</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>The solution</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>A concise and clear overview of the tech is provided, including details of its functionality  
  
· A clear outline of the target marker/user of the tech is given, including how the tech solves a problem and meets the needs of the target user  
· Ethical considerations are demonstrated, including an awareness of potential issues and how this may have influenced design of the tech</code></pre>
<p>Klarna Klarna is a Multi-choice payment plan creditor which provides
interest free payment plans to contribute / benefit towards the
customer’s payments without them having to pay the amount outright.
Through this, Klarna act as a middle-man service for customers to pay
back a temporary credit based on their purchases.</p>
<p>Properties: - Creditor - Provide loans out to provide a way for
customers to receive items without paying in the full amount straight
away - “BNPL” - A Buy Now Pay Later service provider, one amongst many
other competitors.</p>
<h2 id="business-demands">Business Demands</h2>
<p>Klarna meets the demands of their customer through providing an
intuitive way to manage and maintain pricing for purchases made by
customers, acting as a middleman between the majority of companies for
payment plans.</p>
<p>Though their main selling point is their payment plans, the execution
of the business to meet the demands of a variety of customer markets
have made their business successful in many ways: 1. They have developed
an intuitive app which is personalised with the customer’s details,
preferences and data for customers to access and be kept up to date on
their purchases 2. They have developed a streamline support centre to
handle the majority of customer service chats without the requirement of
a support agent, making a simple and intuitive system to users to handle
disputes. <a href='Things to write About#^klarna|reference'>Things to write About#^klarna|reference</a> 3. They have
understood their customer base by providing personalised recommendations
based on prior searches, purchases and data provided via their third
party vendors. Through this they have optimised the “feed” of content to
keep customers enticed to their products. ## Ethical Considerations</p>
<p>Klarna as a business have to be cautious based on their market sector
being based on temporary debt for their own customers, because of this
there are many potential ethical considerations. Their business strategy
is based on accumulating a debt for their customers until they receive
payments due from the customers. Therefore the business can potentially
downplay the idea of debt and proceed to inflict the chance of customers
going into unmanageable debt The business will have to share details
between third party vendors and customers, as well as handling and
storing the data themselves. If not following the privacy policy
designed by themselves and the third party vendor they could potentially
breach privacy laws expected by the customers. Their advertisements
towards the public have to be considerate of how lenient they can be on
the idea of their business. As any sort of “downplay” towards their
changed version of debt accumulation can be considered an unethical way
to entice customers to use their service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical Analysis</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Evidence of market research is demonstrated through a concise overview of similar/competitor tech within the market.  
  
A summary of the strengths and weaknesses/limitations of the tech is provided  
  
Drawing upon the above, the unique selling points (USPs) of the tech are highlighted – what sets it apart?</code></pre>
<p><a href='Things to write About#^ads-dis|Pro / Con References'>Things to write About#^ads-dis|Pro / Con References</a></p>
<p>Pros - Defer / split payment in accordance to payment plans
available, and are usually paired with a no-interest plan on short-term
deals to better entice and provide seamless ways to pay for customers -
For Businesses and Customers, conversion rates are applied on payment
confirmation to better understand pricing and currency in relevance to
the customer’s location / businesses location, therefore providing a
more relative understanding of what they are purchasing in relevance to
their situation. - A Seamless UI integrated within businesses and their
own platform for customers to view, manage and pay outgoing debts,
alongside looking at available products from platforms partnered with,
providing a continuous feed of content to keep customers on their
app.</p>
<p>Cons - Pre-credit checks are applied on customers to ensure they are
reliable to pay Klarna for using their services, <strong>on
time</strong> - Klarna has fees on products bought through using their
services. - Restrictions on how much you can owe Klarna periodically are
made based on prior history, therefore you cannot limitlessly use their
service based on your history, and credit score.</p>
<p>As Klarna have integrated themselves with 130,000 other active
partners, they are actively pushing other competitors further behind and
make themselves the monopoly of their BNPL market share. This is further
attributed to the idea that, as more partners join Klarna, it becomes
the more convenient for Klarna to be used by customers as their details
are already synchronised across their platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Opportunity Spotting / Innovation and Impact</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>An outline of opportunities presented by the tech is provided e.g. how could it be developed to improve functionality and impact and/or value to user?  
  
Demonstrable understanding of the key resources needed for development e.g physical, technical, financial resources and stakeholders  
  
There is consideration of potential threats to successful development of the tech. Reference to further ethical considerations may be applicable here.</code></pre>

<h1 id="paypal-credit">Paypal Credit</h1>
<p>ref: https://merchantmachine.co.uk/bnpl/klarna-vs-paypal-credit/</p>
<p>Paypal Credit is one amongst the other competitors Klarna have to
compare against. Paypal Credit is also a BNPL-based provider and
competes in the market for providing the accessible service that Klarna
provides, however has benefits by different means. 1. They have longer
payment plans including 4 months at 0% interest, and longer dependent on
the purchase amount 2. Unlike Klarna, they cannot provide in-store
purchases however are more devoted to the online-based service that they
provide, such as e-commerce websites. 3. Fees on their services for
businesses/corporate are lower to use at 1.2% which makes businesses
more inclined to use them</p>
